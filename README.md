# Introduction to Decorators - Tutorial given at PyCon Online 2020

This repository contains supporting material for the **Introduction to Decorators - Power Up Your Python Code** tutorial I presented at the [Pycon Online 2020](https://us.pycon.org/2020/online/) conference.

The tutorial is available as a video at _COMING SOON_. Unfortunately, the files in this repository will not make a lot of sense without the video.

The course is organized around 6 different exercises that show different techniques for constructing decorators in Python.

- [Exercise 1](code/task01.py): Your first decorator
- [Exercise 2](code/task02.py): Decorators that use the function arguments
- [Exercise 3](code/task03.py): Decorators that don't wrap the original function
- [Exercise 4](code/task04.py): Decorators that keep state
- [Exercise 5](code/task05.py): Decorators with arguments
- [Exercise 6](code/task06.py): Decorators with optional arguments
